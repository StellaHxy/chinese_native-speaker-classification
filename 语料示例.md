# 语料示例：

## 示例一：

    Designing protein sequences that fold to a given three-dimensional (3D) structure has long been a challenging problem in computational structural biology with significant theoretical and practical implications.
    谓语：has been
    非谓语：desinging
    从句：that引导的修饰sequences的定语从句
    属于复合句
    无副词，无插入语，无被动结构
    label：Chinese

## 示例二：

    The inverse protein folding (IPF) problem, which was raised in 1983 by Pabo,11 is the problem of finding the amino acid sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional (3D) structure. 
    谓语：is
    非谓语：finding
    从句：which引导的修饰problem的定语从句，that引导的修饰sequences的定语从句
    属于复合句
    被动结构：was raised
    无副词，无插入语
    label: Chinese

    We generated random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting distance maps, which as expected are quite featureless.
    谓语：generated，input
    非谓语：to predict
    从句：which引导的修饰distance maps的定语从句，状语从句as expected
    属于复合句，并且是并列句
    副词: quite
    无被动结构，无插入语。
    label: native speaker

## 示例三：

    Key to such successes is robust sequence design methods that minimize the folded-state energy of a pre-specified backbone conformation, which can either be derived from existing structures or generated de novo.
    主句谓语：is...
    非谓语结构：无
    副词：either
    从句：that minimize...、which can either...
    插入语:无
    复合句、有被动形态
    连词：or
    label：native speaker

## 示例四：

    Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5].
    主句谓语：have been firmly established
    非谓语结构：无
    副词：firmly
    从句：无
    插入语：in particular
